# Entitiex

Entitiex is an Elixir presenter library used to transform data structures. This is useful when the desired representation doesn't match the schema defined within the domain model.  I'd say it's a kind of `Grape::Entity` ported from the Ruby world.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `entitiex` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:entitiex, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

## Examples

---

Inspired by [`grape-entity`](https://github.com/ruby-grape/grape-entity) gem.
